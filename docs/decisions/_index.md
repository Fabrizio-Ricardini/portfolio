# Decision Records (ADRs) Index

ADRs are the source of truth for major decisions and their rationale.

## MUST READ
- `0001-architecture.md` (accepted)
- `0002-testing-quality-gates.md` (accepted)
- `0003-repo-structure-ownership.md` (accepted)

## Rules
- If a decision changes, create a new ADR and mark the previous as **superseded**.
- Keep ADR status aligned with actual operating state (avoid long-lived `proposed` records for active decisions).
