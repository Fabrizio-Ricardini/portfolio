## Fabrizio — Full Stack Developer

> "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." — John Johnson

I'm a developer passionate about building performant web applications
and crafting elegant user experiences. With 5+ years of experience
shipping production software, I specialize in the React/Node.js
ecosystem and cloud-native architectures.

### Background
Started coding at 16 with Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Quickly moved to web development and never looked back. Today I work
across the full stack — from database design to pixel-perfect UIs.

### Philosophy
- Write code for humans first, machines second.
- Ship early, iterate often.
- Every abstraction has a cost; choose wisely.

### Currently
- Building dual-mode portfolio experiences (you're looking at one).
- Exploring AI-assisted development workflows.
- Contributing to open source when time allows.
